# Agent Operating Guide

This repository uses the durable multi-agent workflow in `.agents/`.

When the user says, "use agents to check and finish the work and you review their work", treat it as a direct instruction to run the finish-and-review workflow:

1. Use `.agents/workflows/finish-and-review.md`.
2. Have the relevant specialist agents inspect and complete the work.
3. Use the `orchestrator` role to review the specialists' output before final handoff.

Before making non-trivial changes, read:

1. `.agents/README.md` for the overall workflow.
2. `.agents/registry.md` to choose the right agent roles.
3. The specific files in `.agents/agents/` for role instructions.
4. The matching playbook in `.agents/workflows/` for the task type.

Default behavior:

- Use the `orchestrator` role to frame the task, select specialists, and keep scope controlled.
- Preserve the current React/Vite/Tailwind structure unless the task explicitly requires a different architecture.
- Treat this as a personal portfolio site: edits should protect warmth, credibility, accessibility, and polish.
- Run `npm run build` before handing off code changes whenever possible.
- Never overwrite user content, portfolio copy, or assets without calling it out.
